# Multi-Cursor++
Multi-cursor++ adds new features to the multi-cursor functionality within Visual Studio Code to give that extra convenience while programming.

## Currently in Early Development
Right now, Multi-Cursor++ is not planned to be in productive use yet. However, new features and developments are coming

> **Note:** The previous GitHub repo was too unmanageable, so I made this new one (just for a heads up)
